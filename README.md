# <Portfolio>

## Description

My porfolio diplays a brief synopsis of who I am, the work I have done that is related to coding, contact info to reach out to me, and my resume. The portfolio contains HTML and CSS as of currently.

## Installation

No installation required to use the website.

## Usage

Here is the URL to my Portfolio: https://richard-au1.github.io/Portfolio/

In the header there are four buttons that can be pressed to be sent into a section relating on each button pressed. Each button will have a gray background when moused over. For example, if Work is pressed then it will send the user down to the Work History Section shown below.
