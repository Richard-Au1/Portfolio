# <Horiseon Homepage>

## Description

Horiseon challenge allowed html and basic css to be implemented into a website to be learned. Fomatting is important to make sure classes, ids, and other elements are called correctly so element's styles are not overriding each other.
This was a stepping stone on how to compact and be concise calling to the same class's styles so and not have repeating code in the css file. 

## Installation

No installation required to use the website.

## Usage

The Website diplays a brief synopsis of who I am, the work I have done that is related to coding, contact info to reach out to me, and my resume. In the header there are four buttons that can be pressed to be sent into a section relating on each button pressed. For example, if Work is pressed then it will send the user down to the Work History Section shown below.
